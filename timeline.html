                <h2>Joined Cal Band Computer Committee</h2>
                <h3>September, 2018</h3>
                <p>The Cal Band relies heavily on an internal website built with Django.
                    For this website I've done mostly backend work in python. I hope to 
                    contribute to many more projects for the website this coming spring 
                    semester.

                <h2>Software Intern at Socket Mobile</h2>
                <h3>Summer, 2018</h3>
                <p>Being the only intern this summer, I was tasked with many 
                    various projects in which I had no previous experience.
                    I had to learn C#, bash scripting, batch scripting (for windows), 
                    XML, .NET framework, and YModem. This summer also helped me improve upon 
                    my python and git skills, as I used those almost every day. 
                    All the projects I completed are detailed in the "Projects" page.

                <h3>Summer, 2017</h3>
                <p>Without much computer science experience, I started off doing 
                    regular intern work such as asset management, some server management, 
                    etc. Later on I did some light coding projects. I made C++ tables that 
                    mapped HID keyboard codes to keys. Each table represented a different 
                    international keybaord layout.

                <h2>Declared Computer Science as my Major</h2>
                <h3>Spring, 2017</h3>
                <p>I finished up my last lower division requirement for the CS major! 
                    With lower division classes done, I looked forward to the Upper 
                    Division classes with larger programming projects and more in-depth 
                    content.

                <h2>Super Bowl 50 Halftime Show</h2>
                <h3>February, 2016</h3>
                <p>The Cal Band was asked to perform alongside Coldplay for the show! 
                    This Super Bowl performance broke the record for the largest TV 
                    audience in history. Although this isn't necessarily a professional 
                    achievement, it's one of the greatest memories of my drumming career.

                <h3>Fall, 2015</h3>
                <p>I came to Berkeley not certain of what I wanted to major in. 
                    I started off taking many various intro classes: Math, Astro, 
                    "The Beauty and Joy of Computing". The CS class was by far the 
                    most fun, so I decided to go with that.

                <h2>Blue Devils B</h2>
                <h3>Summer, 2015</h3>
                <p>I was finally able to achieve one of my most long term goals 
                    of being a Blue Devil. Over 70 people auditioned for one spot 
                    and I was lucky enough to be the one chosen. We toured California 
                    as well as much of the Midwest and finally placed second at the Drum 
                    Corps International Open Class Finals.
