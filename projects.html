                <h2>Virtual Reality Drum Simulator</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a program for the Oculus Rift that allows it's user 
                    to practice the drums and other various percussion instruments 
                    in a virtualized environment. As a drummer I see a lot of utility 
                    in this kind of application; it's very hard to practice the drums due 
                    to their price and the fact that they're too loud to be played in 
                    most public spaces. This was my first time doing anything with 
                    virtual reality or Unity, so the learning curve was a bit steep. 
                    The main functionality of the drum simulator is to pick up and hold 
                    virtual drum sticks with the hand-held Oculus controllers and play/practice 
                    whatever instrument is in front of you. The simulator also includes a marimba
                    so that users could also practice that too. One of the main problems with 
                    virtual reality applications is motion sickness. To alleviate that, 
                    the simulator features teleportation. The user simply points and shoots 
                    at another instrument in the virtual drum room and they are instantly 
                    transported to that instrument. We also featured audio recording and playback, 
                    and vibration for tactile feedback to the user.
                </p>
                <h2>Graphics Engine</h2>
                <p>This graphics engine features a simple 2D graphics engine that 
                    could be used to make games or animations. I optimized the engine 
                    to be able to handle rendering over 10,000 textured sprites at 60 
                    frames per second, and this is on an old computer that only has Intel's 
                    CPU graphics. The engine also features the rendering of textured 3D 
                    shapes and objects, and a 3D "sandbox" mode that allows the user 
                    to have the effect of flying around the 3D rendered world. This 
                    project was another on of my earlier projects. I wanted to learn C++ 
                    and I thought (correcty) that this would be a fun project. I didn't 
                    know what I was getting myself into with graphics programming, so by 
                    accident I learned some OpenGL along with the C++.

                <h2>Tied (animated short film)</h2>
                <p>I made a short film called "Tied" with a group of 4 as a part of the UCBUGG
                    organization at Berkeley. We made the entire thing in Autodesk Maya. This 
                    includes modeling, rigging, animating, and rendering. Although 
                    this wasn't a programming project, it was very tough to 
                    finish and it helped me improve my teamwork skills. The short 
                    can be watched 
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sm7wdAa_6fM">here.</a>

                <h2>Bomberman</h2>
                <p>For my first big programming project me and one of 
                    my friends made a Bomberman emulator entirely from 
                    scratch in Snap. This version has both multiplayer 
                    and single player options. Multiplayer is full of 
                    various advantageous items and power-ups. Single player 
                    features many levels with some basic AIs. Overall it was 
                    a very fun project that taught me the essentials of 
                    programming.

                <h1>Socket Mobile</h1>
                <h2>Scanner Model Web API</h2>
                <p>For this project I had to convert an existing PHP/MySQL 
                    web api to an Azure/C# web api. Previously the scanner apps 
                    had been using another company's Cake PHP based web api to 
                    pull JSON data from a MySQL database. Socket Mobile wanted 
                    host this web-api/database internally because it would be easier to manage, but 
                    Socket Mobile operates through the microsoft ecosystem with 
                    Windows servers. Using Azure Tables as a database and C#/
                    .NET api as the backend would make the most sense. Azure tables 
                    are not meant for storing large amounts of data, so I 
                    had to compress all of the entries before storing them in the 
                    table and decompress them when queried. I made an admin page 
                    for database maintanence (primarily adding new model entries). 
                    The whole website had authenticated security; I used an SQL database 
                    for a list of users and their encrypted/salted passwords. Each 
                    user is required to login with their passwords, and only priveledged 
                    users were allowed to access the admin page.
                </p>
                <h2>Scan Engine Updater</h2>
                <p>This program was used by the Operations team to install 
                    and update firmware in the tiny engines inside of the 
                    scanners we make. I used C# and implemented the Y-Modem 
                    transfer protocal. I configured the program to be as user 
                    friendly and efficient as possible; after plugging in the 
                    engine to a circuit board, all you have to do is press any 
                    button on the keyboard and watch a progress bar. Multiple 
                    engines could be programmed simultaneously as well. All in all, 
                    it greatly improved the efficiency of programming hundreds of 
                    scan engines.

                <h2>Automatic Sharepoint Uploader</h2>
                <p>
                    I wrote several Powershell and python programs that upload new scanner 
                    firmware builds to Sharepoint. New versions of the firmware needed to 
                    be QA tested. The QA testing was handled by another company, and Sharepoint 
                    was where they accessed the binaries for the new builds. The powershell part 
                    was not too bad because there were libraries that made the whole process 
                    relatively simple with a few function calls. I had to use python for other 
                    builds that were on a Mac. The python was more difficult because I had to 
                    format and send HTTP requests to Sharepoints web-api. I then recieved 
                    an authenticated token, which I used for another HTTP request to upload 
                    my data to sharepoint. I encrypted the password used for authentification 
                    and didn't add it to the repository. The encrypted password file only 
                    existed on the build servers themselves.
                </p>
                <h2>Data Conversion Program</h2>
                <p>This was a helper program for the web-api described at the top 
                    of this section. The program pulls the raw JSON data from the old 
                    web-api, reformats certain entries, compresses the data, and then 
                    uses Microsoft's .NET libraries to insert entries into the Azure 
                    database. 
                </p>
                <h2>Firmware Installers</h2>
                <p>
                    I created Windows installer applications using WiX (XML). 
                    These installers were used for quickly updating test 
                    fixtures with the latest firmware builds.
                </p>
                <h2>HID Keyboard Tables</h2>
                <p>
                    I created a script that made tables mapping HID key codes to 
                    key inputs. Each table represented a different keyboard layout (US, 
                    International, French, Chinese, etc.). These tables were used 
                    in the scanners' "keyboard" mode which allows the scanners to 
                    output data being scanned to a computer.

                <h2>AYPC (A python compiler)</h2>
                <p>
                    A python compiler written in C++ for CS 164 in a team of 3. Python 
                    files are first lexed and parsed to create an "abstract syntax 
                    tree", or AST. This part was written in Flex/Bison, which are 
                    languages designed specifically for lexing and parsing. The 
                    compiler then performs static semantic analysis on the AST; 
                    this handles scoping rules and the other semantics defined 
                    by Python 2.7. Primarily, this stage tags each variable with 
                    a number that represents its declaration (variables with the 
                    same name that were declared in a different scope will have 
                    different names i.e x-297 and x-300). After static semantic 
                    analysis, the compiler generates C++ code using the tagged
                    abstract syntax tree. Most of the common compilers generate 
                    assembly code, but generating and then compiling C++ code 
                    works fine. The only benefit of going straight to assembly is 
                    further optimization of the code. However, optimization is 
                    extremely tricky and far out of the scope of an intro compiler 
                    class.

                <h2>PintOS</h2>
                <p>
                    PintOS is an educational operating system that I implemented 
                    for CS 162 in a team of 4. PintOS is a simple operating system 
                    where processes are limited to one thread. We did not implement 
                    all parts of PintOS. We implimented a clock system to put to sleep 
                    and reawaken threads, synchronization primatives (locks & semaphores), 
                    a priority scheduler, an MLFQ scheduler, argument passing for user 
                    programs, process control syscalls, file operation syscalls, a buffer 
                    cache for disk blocks, an extensible file system, and a directory system. 
                    I contributed to all of these parts of the project except for argument 
                    passing for user programs (this was done all by another group member). 
                    Implementing these features in PintOS was not easy, and it required us 
                    to gain a deep level of understanding of core OS concepts. Debugging this 
                    project was a giant headache, and it greatly improved my GDB and C++ 
                    skills.
