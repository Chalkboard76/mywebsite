                <h2>Virtual Reality Drum Simulator</h2>
                <p>
                    This is a program for the Oculus Rift that allows it's user 
                    to practice the drums and other various percussion instruments 
                    in a virtualized environment. As a drummer I see a lot of utility 
                    in this kind of application; it's very hard to practice the drums due 
                    to their price and the fact that they're too loud to be played in 
                    most public spaces. This was my first time doing anything with 
                    virtual reality or Unity, so the learning curve was a bit steep. 
                    The main functionality of the drum simulator is to pick up and hold 
                    virtual drum sticks with the hand-held Oculus controllers and play/practice 
                    whatever instrument is in front of you. The simulator also includes a marimba
                    so that users could also practice that too. One of the main problems with 
                    virtual reality applications is motion sickness. To alleviate that, 
                    the simulator features teleportation. The user simply points and shoots 
                    at another instrument in the virtual drum room and they are instantly 
                    transported to that instrument. We also featured audio recording and playback, 
                    and vibration for tactile feedback to the user.
